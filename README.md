### Hi there, I'm Jacob ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Jacob-Folley/Jacob-Folley** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a software developer with strong problem solving skills. I enjoy the challenges of new projects and I love working in a team setting as well as independently. While I am not coding, I love to spend time exploring nature and reading books. Aside from programming, my main passion is cooking, meditation, and learning history!

### Let's connect!
