### Hi there, I'm Jacob 👋

**Jacob-Folley/Jacob-Folley** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a software developer with strong problem solving skills. I enjoy the challenges of new projects and I love working in a team setting as well as independently. While I am not coding, I love to spend time exploring nature and reading books. Aside from programming, my main passion is cooking, meditation, and learning history!
